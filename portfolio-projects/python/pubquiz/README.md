# PUB QUIZ GAME

For my project, I developed a pub quiz game using Python where the user is prompted to enter their name. The game then displays a question and multiple-choice answers in the terminal, and the user responds by selecting either the "a," "b," or "c" key and pressing enter.

The game asks as many questions as are listed in the question set, which in this case is 25 questions. At the end, the program shows the player how many points they scored in the quiz and saves the result along with the player's name in a folder created in the root directory of the computer.
