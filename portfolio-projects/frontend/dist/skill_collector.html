            During the Future Factory course at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I took the lead in designing the user interface for the Skill Collector app. This project, funded by the Lippa project, aimed to enhance ICT education by identifying essential skills for the current and future IT industry. The app played a crucial role in collecting data to inform JAMK's course adjustments based on industry needs.
            <br><br>
            Our team developed the Skill Collector app to bridge the gap between IT companies and schools, facilitating discussions about industry-specific skills. This empowered educational providers to effectively adapt their programs to meet industry demands.
            <br><br>
            In our app, users input a hash code to start the questionnaire. They selected the five most important skills, five important skills, five valuable skills, future skills, and soft skills they believed were crucial for their IT roles. These skills were predetermined SFIA-skills. At the end of the survey, users could provide feedback.
            <br><br>
            My primary focus was on designing the user interface for the Skill Collector app. We were tasked with incorporating JAMK's brand colors and ensuring the application's ease of use, given the extensive list of over 120 skills to choose from. To provide users with information about each skill, we implemented a hover effect allowing users to learn more about a skill by hovering over its name. Additionally, I implemented intuitive features to enable users to effortlessly delete and modify chosen skills.
